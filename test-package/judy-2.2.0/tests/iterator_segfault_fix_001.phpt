--EXPECT--
Testing Iterator next() method for segfault prevention:

=== Testing INT_TO_INT next() without rewind() ===
Calling next() without rewind() first...
next() completed successfully
Current state - valid(): true

=== Testing INT_TO_MIXED next() without rewind() ===
Calling next() without rewind() first...
next() completed successfully
Current state - valid(): true

=== Testing empty INT_TO_INT next() without rewind() ===
Calling next() on empty Judy without rewind()...
next() completed successfully
Current state - valid(): false

=== Testing multiple next() calls without rewind() ===
First next() call...
Second next() call...
Third next() call...
All next() calls completed successfully

=== Testing mixed operations ===
rewind()...
next()...
next() again without rewind...
Mixed operations completed successfully

All tests completed without segmentation fault!
