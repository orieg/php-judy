1. INTRODUCTION
-----------------

php-judy is an extension by Nicolas Brousse for the Judy C library.
  -> http://pecl.php.net/package/Judy
  -> http://github.com/orieg/php-judy

Structures available in the PHP Judy extension :
 - BITSET (using Judy1)
 - INT_TO_INT (using JudyL)
 - INT_TO_MIXED (using JudyL)
 - STRING_TO_INT (using JudySL)
 - STRING_TO_MIXED (using JudySL)

A Judy array is a complex but very fast associative array data structure for
storing and looking up values using integer or string keys. Unlike normal
arrays, Judy arrays may be sparse; that is, they may have large ranges of
unassigned indices.

  -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_array

The PHP extension is base on the Judy C library that implements a dynamic array.
A Judy array consumes memory only when populated yet can grow to take advantage
of all available memory.  Judy's key benefits are:  scalability, performance,
memory efficiency, and ease of use. Judy arrays are designed to grow without
tuning into the peta-element range, scaling near O(log-base-256) -- 1 more RAM
access at 256 X population.

3. HOW TO INSTALL
------------------

Note : This extension has only been tested with php 5.3.3 on Ubuntu Karmic 32bit.

  phpize
  ./configure --with-judy[=DIR]
  make
  make test
  make install

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian, you can install libJudy with apt :

  apt-get install libjudydebian1 libjudy-dev
  phpize
  ./configure --with-judy=/usr
  make
  make test
  make install
  
On Windows, you will need to build LibJudy yourself.

        Download the sources at 

	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/judy/
	  
	Extract the sources, and open the Visual Studio command prompt and navigate to 
	the source directory. Then execute:

	  build
	  
	This creates "Judy.lib", copy this into the php-sdk library folder and name it 

	 libJudy.lib
	 
	Then copy the include file "judy.h" into the php-sdk includes folder. Now its 
	time to build pecl/judy, extract the pecl/judy into your build folder where 
	the build scripts will be able to pick it up, e.g.:
	
	 C:\php\pecl\judy\
	 
	If your source of PHP is located in:
	
	 C:\php\src\
	 
	The rest of the steps is pretty straight forward, like any other external 
	extension:
	
	 buildconf
	 configure --with-judy=shared
	 nmake
  
You can check everything is ok by running :

  php -f judy.php

5. TODO
--------

 * Implements comparator and cast handler
 * Add bitset comparator (cf. Judy1Op sample)
 * Test compile/install on other platform
