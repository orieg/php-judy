# PHP Judy Performance Benchmarks

This document provides a detailed performance and memory usage comparison between the `php-judy` extension and native PHP arrays. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven guidance on when to use each data structure.

## üéØ **Quick Decision Guide**

**Use Judy Arrays When:**
- ‚úÖ Memory is constrained (3.5x less memory usage)
- ‚úÖ Sequential access patterns (3x faster than PHP arrays)
- ‚úÖ Large sparse integer datasets (> 1M elements)
- ‚úÖ Iterator-based operations (`foreach ($judy as $k => $v)`)

**Use PHP Arrays When:**
- ‚ùå Random access patterns (5x faster than Judy)
- ‚ùå Small datasets (< 100k elements)
- ‚ùå Performance-critical string operations
- ‚ùå Memory is not a constraint

**Hybrid Approach:**
- üîÑ Use Judy for storage, convert to PHP array for random access

## üìä **Performance Summary**

| Access Pattern | Dataset Size | Judy vs PHP | Recommendation |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Random Access** | Any size | 5x slower | Use PHP arrays |
| **Sequential Access** | > 10M elements | 3x faster | Use Judy iterators |
| **Sequential Access** | < 1M elements | Similar | Use PHP arrays |
| **Memory Usage** | Any size | 3.5x less | Use Judy if memory constrained |

## Benchmark Methodology

The benchmarks were executed using a script that tests two realistic, large-scale scenarios:

1.  **Sparse Integer Keys:** Simulates use cases like storing data by non-sequential IDs (e.g., database primary keys). This is the ideal use case for Judy arrays.
2.  **Random String Keys:** Simulates common use cases like associative arrays, caches, or dictionaries where keys are strings.

For each scenario, the following operations were measured:
*   **Write Time:** The time taken to populate the data structure.
*   **Read Time:** The time taken to perform random-access reads of every key.
*   **Memory Footprint:** The total memory consumed by the data structure.

### Memory Measurement Methodology

**PHP Arrays:** Memory usage is measured using PHP's `memory_get_usage(true)` function, which provides accurate real memory consumption.

**Judy Arrays:** 
- **Integer-based Judy arrays** use the native `memoryUsage()` method for precise measurements
- **String-based Judy arrays** use estimated memory based on size and average key length (since `memoryUsage()` returns NULL for string keys)

All tests were performed using the `php:8.1-cli` Docker image to ensure a consistent and isolated environment. The full benchmark scripts can be found in `examples/run-benchmarks.php` and individual benchmark files in the `examples/` directory.

**Note:** These benchmark results reflect the performance optimizations ecently implemented, including cached type flags in iterator methods, aggressive compiler optimizations, and critical iterator bug fixes. The results show measurable improvements over previous versions while maintaining the same memory efficiency characteristics.

## Benchmark Results

The following tables summarize the results for datasets ranging from 100,000 to 10,000,000 elements.

## Key Findings

### Memory Efficiency
- **Judy arrays excel at memory efficiency** for sparse integer data, offering **over 2x memory savings (up to 3.8x in tests)** compared to PHP arrays
- **String-based Judy arrays** show moderate memory savings but with performance trade-offs
- **PHP arrays** are more memory-intensive but offer better performance for most workloads

### Performance Characteristics
- **Access Pattern Sensitivity**: Judy arrays are extremely sensitive to access patterns:
  - **Random Access**: Judy performs poorly due to cache locality issues (5x slower than PHP at 10M elements)
  - **Sequential Access**: Judy excels with sorted keys or iterator operations (3x faster than PHP at large scales)
  - **Iterator Performance**: Optimized `valid()` method provides O(1) performance instead of expensive lookups
- **Key Sparseness Impact**: Judy's performance is heavily affected by key distribution:
  - **Extremely sparse keys** (large gaps) can make string keys faster than integer keys
  - **Reasonable sparse keys** (small gaps) show integer keys performing much better than string keys
  - **Current benchmark uses extremely sparse keys** (gaps of 500-1500), which may not represent real-world usage

### Latest Performance Improvements (v2.2.0)
- **Iterator Optimization**: `valid()` method now uses cached state instead of expensive Judy library calls
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical iterator behavior issues that could cause incorrect iteration patterns
- **Security Enhancement**: Removed `-fno-stack-protector` flag while maintaining performance optimizations
- **Performance Impact**: 100K element iteration completes in ~8ms with optimized iterator methods

### Latest Benchmark Results (v2.2.0)

**Performance Comparison (1M elements):**
- **Judy Arrays**: Write: 105.88ms, Read: 101.78ms, Memory: 7.94 MB
- **PHP Arrays**: Write: 32.45ms, Read: 10.6ms, Memory: 34 MB

**Access Pattern Performance (100K elements):**
- **Random Access**: 7.3ms (shuffled keys with `isset()`)
- **Sequential Access**: 5.5ms (sorted keys with `isset()`)
- **Judy Iterator**: 15.91ms (direct `foreach`)
- **Manual Iterator**: 20.76ms (`rewind`/`valid`/`next`)

**Key Insights:**
- Judy provides 4.3x memory savings over PHP arrays
- Sequential access is faster than random access
- Iterator performance scales well with dataset size
- Manual iterator is slightly slower than direct `foreach` due to method call overhead
- **Performance Anomaly Explained**: String keys appear faster than integer keys in benchmarks due to extremely sparse key generation (gaps of 500-1500)
- **Real-world Performance**: With reasonable sparse keys (gaps of 2-10), integer keys are 2-3x faster than string keys
  - **Sequential Access**: Judy excels and beats PHP arrays (3x faster at 10M elements)
  - **Iterator Performance**: Judy's built-in iterators provide optimal performance
- **PHP arrays** are generally faster for random access patterns
- **Judy arrays** show improved performance with Phase 2.2 optimizations while maintaining memory benefits
- **String-based Judy arrays** have higher performance overhead compared to integer-based ones

### Scale-Dependent Performance
- **Small Datasets (< 1M elements)**: Sequential access with sorted keys may be faster than Judy iterators
- **Large Datasets (> 10M elements)**: Judy iterators become significantly faster than sequential access
- **Crossover Point**: Iterator performance becomes optimal around 1-10M elements

## When to Use Judy Arrays

### ‚úÖ **Use Judy Arrays When:**

**1. Memory-Constrained Environments**

### ‚ùå **Avoid Judy Arrays When:**

- When random access performance is critical
- **Reason**: 5x slower than PHP arrays for random access

**2. Small Datasets**

**3. String-Based Keys (Performance Critical)**
- When performance is more important than memory
- High-frequency string key operations

## How to Use Judy Arrays Effectively

### **Optimal Usage Patterns:**

**‚úÖ DO: Use Judy's Iterator (Best Performance)**
```php
$judy = new Judy(Judy::INT_TO_INT);
// ... populate data ...

// Optimal: Use Judy's iterator
foreach ($judy as $key => $value) {
    // Process each key-value pair
    echo "$key => $value\n";
}
```

**‚úÖ DO: Sequential Access with Sorted Keys**
```php
$judy = new Judy(Judy::INT_TO_INT);
// ... populate data ...

// Good: Sort keys first, then access sequentially
$keys = array_keys($judy->toArray());
sort($keys);
foreach ($keys as $key) {
    $value = $judy[$key];
    // Process value
}
```

**‚ùå DON'T: Random Access Patterns**
```php
$judy = new Judy(Judy::INT_TO_INT);
// ... populate data ...

// Avoid: Random access is very slow
$random_keys = [1000, 50000, 2000, 75000, 3000];
foreach ($random_keys as $key) {
    $value = $judy[$key]; // Very slow!
}
```

### **Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds):**
```php
// Use Judy for storage and sequential access
$judy = new Judy(Judy::INT_TO_INT);
// ... populate data ...

// Convert to PHP array for random access when needed
$php_array = $judy->toArray();

// Now you can do fast random access
$value = $php_array[50000]; // Fast random access
```

### **Performance Guidelines:**

**For Large Datasets (> 10M elements):**
- Use Judy iterators for best performance
- Avoid random access patterns
- Consider hybrid approach for mixed access patterns

**For Small Datasets (< 1M elements):**
- Sequential access with sorted keys may be faster than iterators
- Consider PHP arrays if memory isn't a constraint

**For Memory-Constrained Environments:**
- Judy arrays are always beneficial
- Use iterators for optimal performance
- Avoid converting to PHP arrays unless necessary
