echo "‚ùå Random access: Slower than PHP arrays for random access patterns\n";
echo "‚ùå Small datasets: Overhead not justified for small data\n";
echo "‚ùå String operations: Higher overhead than integers\n";
echo "‚ùå Unordered sparse keys: Performance degrades with sparse data\n\n";

echo "üöÄ RECOMMENDED USE CASES:\n";
echo "‚Ä¢ Large sparse integer datasets (>1M elements)\n";
echo "‚Ä¢ Sequential data processing and analytics\n";
echo "‚Ä¢ Memory-constrained applications\n";
echo "‚Ä¢ Range queries and ordered operations\n";
